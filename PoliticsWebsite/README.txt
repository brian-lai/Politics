Mission Statement:
	Our mission is to make politics easier and more accessible to college age voters.
	We provide all points of views collecting from various websites in a succinct way,
	and all the information you need to vote.


How PolyC Works:
	Polyc makes learning about Politics easier, and does all the heavy lifting for you.
	What we do is give you easy categories to choose from and then give you the ability
	to read articles about that topic from multiple perspectives. You don't even have to 
	look for an article.

	Since we aim to get young voters into the polls we also provide information on
	voting and how to vote as a first time voter. We make it easy to find a polling
	place, register, apply, and much more!
